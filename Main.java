 * bat left and right to prevent a bouncing ball from going beyond it to the bottom 
 * of the screen. The ball will bounce around the game area bouncing off the walls and
 * blocks with the collison with the blocks casuing them to break and earn the player
 * score. The level will end when all the blocks are destroyed.
